**hardware-based address translation** translates virual address into physical address

physical address = virtual address + base

**base and bounds aka dynamic relocation**
base is the start of the address space and bounds is the end

**Memory management unit MMU** part of processor that helps with address translation

**internal fragmentation** is the space between stack and heap that can be wasted
